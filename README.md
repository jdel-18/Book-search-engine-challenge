# Book-search-engine-challenge
 
## Description
This project had us start with fully functining code using the google books API, and our objective was to change it to be build with GraphQL with Apollo server. To finish this project I needed to set up an Apollo server using GraphQL and mutations to fetch and modify data, modify the existing middleware so it works with the GraphQL API, set up an Apollo so the project can communicate with the server, and deploy the project to heroku.
